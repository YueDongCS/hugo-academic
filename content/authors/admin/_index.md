Hi, I am Yue Dong, an assistant professor of computer science and engineering at [the University of California, Riverside](https://www1.cs.ucr.edu/). I obtained my PhD in Computer Science at[McGill University](http://cs.mcgill.ca) and [Mila](https://mila.quebec), supervised by Dr. [Jackie Cheung](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~jcheung/). I was fortunate to intern at Google AI, AI2, Microsoft, and Huawei Noah’s Ark Lab during my PhD.

My research interests include natural language processing, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. I lead the Natural Language Processing group at UCR, which develops natural language understanding and generation systems that are controllable, trustworthy, and efficient.  I am looking for self-motivated PhDs / masters / interns to work in the area of NLP, please consider [applying](https://www1.cs.ucr.edu//graduate/admissions/overview) if you are interested in working with me.
